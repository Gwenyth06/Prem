This is a Chrome extension designed to remind you to take your pills while surfing the web for prolonged periods.
It is not yet complete

## Features

- You can add as many reminders as chrome storage permissions allow which has "unlimitedStorage" option (I did not test it.).  
- For future feature: I might track which medicine you took or not by saving data from notification buttons and delay the notifications for 5 more mins if no buttons are clicked.

## Install
